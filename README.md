## 💻 About Me

I'm passionate about building practical, efficient applications tailored to business needs.  
Over the past years, I have worked on various government, private, and freelance projects — from ministry-wide education systems to business-specific sales tools.

💡 My desktop systems are fully built with **VB.NET** and **SQL Server**, where I follow a clean-code approach and use:
- Stored Procedures for all database operations
- Modular and maintainable architecture
- Strong data validation and user-focused interfaces

I always strive to follow software engineering best practices, especially:
- ✅ **SOLID** design principles  
- ✅ Common **Design Patterns** (Repository Pattern, Unit of Work, Dependency Injection, etc.)
